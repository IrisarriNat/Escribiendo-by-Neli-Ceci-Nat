The original repository has been developed by me (Cecilia Mermoz), Natalia Irriazi and Nelida Marcos. I had forked to improved more changes to the videogame that it contains. It's already working but it's improves are still a work in progress. It's only developed for desktop at the moment, the responsive assets will be one of the improves to develop in the future. 

Things to work on:

- Work on the arrays of words
- Responsive
- HighScore (at least in LocalStorage)
- Modelo -> listadoPalabras -> generate a filter that only allows larger-than-3-character words, to be selected from the array. This filter maybe be useful on a harder-level situation.

- bug tarda el countdown en refrescar cuando compete
- bug de highscore (despu√©s de entrar dos veces en el ELSE, resetea el highscore a 0.. es decir cuando se queda dos veces sin vida)
